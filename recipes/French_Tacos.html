    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">French tacos (“tacos” can be plural or singular) consist of late-night staples like french fries and chicken fingers topped with cheese, folded into a flour tortilla, and cooked on a griddle. While French cuisine usually conjures images of rich, heavy dishes redolent of butter and cream, this simple sandwich has become popular nationwide (and beyond).

        Popular French tacos filling include doner kebab, chicken cordon bleu, ground beef, or even merguez sausage. Some chefs incorporate cabbage, pickles, or lettuce for a fresh taste to contrast the heavier flavors. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Tortillas</strong>: Large flour tortillas to wrap the fillings.</li>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: You can use grilled chicken, beef, kebab meat, or even merguez sausages. You can mix different types of meat if you prefer. </li>
        <li><strong>French Fries</strong>: A key ingredient inside the wrap, giving it a signature texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Sauce</strong>: Usually a creamy cheese sauce (like cheddar or a mix with cream) is used. Some recipes use béchamel sauce instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Shredded Cheese</strong>: Additional shredded cheese, such as mozzarella or cheddar, can be added for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong>: Paprika, cumin, or other spices to season the meat.</li>
