        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Spaghetti Bolognese is a classic Italian-inspired dish that consists of spaghetti pasta served with a rich and flavorful meat-based sauce known as Bolognese. 
            Originating from the region of Bologna in Italy, the sauce is typically made with ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork), tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, and herbs, all simmered slowly to create a savory, hearty sauce. 
            This comforting and filling dish is a favorite around the world, often topped with grated Parmesan cheese for extra richness.</p>
